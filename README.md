# README

This repository contains the project sources for the Coursera course **Module 3: Getting and Cleaning Data**: _Data, Connetivity and Intelligence: Data Science Track_. Within the top directory, you will find the **run_analysis.R** file for tidying the given messy data set in the course project. Given the project input data set in the same directory, executing the run_analysis.R script file will generate a tidy data set in **tidy_dataset2.txt** file. A **CodeBook** is also provided in the top level directory. The codebook describes the tidy data tidy_dataset2, the transformations executed on the input messy data set to generate the tidy_dataset2.txt file, and the definition of the variables in tidy_dataset2.
